# Paging Demo

This ASP.NET Core MVC Web API is an example of how to easily add paging and sorting to your application.

## How to use the project

Open the project in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2017 and run it.  
Swagger is enabled for the solution, so you can test is directly from a browser. Or you can use Postman to test it.

## How it works

This solution takes advantage of .NET's model binding. If you open [PagingOptions.cs](src\Models\PagingOptions.cs), you'll see it has two properties named Offset and Limit. These are nullable ints, so they are not required. .NET's model binding will grab any inputs from the query string with those names and set the property values. Then in [HomeController.cs](src\Controllers\HomeController.cs), we add **[FromQuery] PagingOptions pagingOptions** to any endpoint we want to page.

Bonus tip:  We're using dependency injection to pull default paging options from our appSettings file.
